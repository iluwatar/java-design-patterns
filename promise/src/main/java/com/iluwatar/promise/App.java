/**
 * The Promise object is used for asynchronous computations. A Promise represents an operation that
 * hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.
 *
 * <p>A Promise represents a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It
 * allows you to associate dependent promises to an asynchronous action's eventual success value or
 * failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of
 * the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise of having a value at some point in the
 * future.
 *
 * <p>Promises provide a few advantages over callback objects:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Functional composition and error handling
 *   <li>Prevents callback hell and provides callback aggregation
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In this application the usage of promise is demonstrated with two examples:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Count Lines: In this example a file is downloaded and its line count is calculated. The
 *       calculated line count is then consumed and printed on console.
 *   <li>Lowest Character Frequency: In this example a file is downloaded and its lowest frequency
 *       character is found and printed on console. This happens via a chain of promises, we start
 *       with a file download promise, then a promise of character frequency, then a promise of
 *       lowest frequency character which is finally consumed and result is printed on console.
 * </ul>
