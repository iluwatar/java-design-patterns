/**
 * With the Microservices pattern, a request often travels through multiple different microservices.
 * Tracking the entire request flow across these services can be challenging, especially when trying
 * to diagnose performance issues or failures. Distributed tracing addresses this challenge by
 * providing end-to-end visibility into the lifecycle of a request as it passes through various
 * microservices.
 *
 * <p>The intent of the Distributed Tracing pattern is to trace a request across different
 * microservices, collecting detailed timing data and logs that help in understanding the flow,
 * performance bottlenecks, and failure points in a distributed system. Each microservice involved
 * in the request contributes to the tracing data, creating a comprehensive view of the request's
 * journey.
 *
 * <p>This implementation demonstrates distributed tracing in a microservices architecture for an
 * e-commerce platform. When a customer places an order, the OrderService interacts with
 * both the PaymentService to process the payment and the ProductService to check the
 * product inventory. Tracing logs are generated for each interaction, and these logs can be
 * visualized using Zipkin.
 *
 * <p>To run Zipkin and view the tracing logs, you can use the following Docker command:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code docker run -d -p 9411:9411 --name zipkin openzipkin/zipkin }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Start Zipkin with the command above. Once Zipkin is running, you can
 * access the Zipkin UI at <a href="http://localhost:9411">http://localhost:9411</a>
 * to view the tracing logs and analyze the request flows across your microservices.
 *
 * <p>To place an order and generate tracing data, you can use the following curl command:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code curl -X POST http://localhost:30300/order -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"orderId": "123"}' }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This command sends a POST request to create an order, which will trigger interactions with the
 * payment and product microservices, generating tracing logs that can be viewed in Zipkin.
