/**
 * The Feature Toggle pattern allows for complete code executions to be turned on or off with ease.
 * This allows features to be controlled by either dynamic methods just as {@link User} information
 * or by {@link Properties}. In the App below there are two examples. Firstly the {@link Properties}
 * version of the feature toggle, where the enhanced version of the welcome message which is
 * personalised is turned either on or off at instance creation. This method is not as dynamic as
 * the {@link User} driven version where the feature of the personalised welcome message is
 * dependent on the {@link UserGroup} the {@link User} is in. So if the user is a member of the
 * {@link UserGroup#isPaid(User)} then they get an enhanced version of the welcome message.
 *
 * <p>Note that this pattern can easily introduce code complexity, and if not kept in check can
 * result in redundant unmaintained code within the codebase.
