/**
 * Arrange/Act/Assert (AAA) is a pattern for organizing unit tests. It is a way to structure your
 * tests, so they're easier to read, maintain and enhance.
 *
 * <p>It breaks tests down into three clear and distinct steps:
 *
 * <p>1. Arrange: Perform the setup and initialization required for the test.
 *
 * <p>2. Act: Take action(s) required for the test.
 *
 * <p>3. Assert: Verify the outcome(s) of the test.
 *
 * <p>This pattern has several significant benefits. It creates a clear separation between a test's
 * setup, operations, and results. This structure makes the code easier to read and understand. If
 * you place the steps in order and format your code to separate them, you can scan a test and
 * quickly comprehend what it does.
 *
 * <p>It also enforces a certain degree of discipline when you write your tests. You have to think
 * clearly about the three steps your test will perform. But it makes tests more natural to write at
 * the same time since you already have an outline.
 *
 * <p>In ({@link CashAAATest}) we have four test methods. Each of them has only one reason to change
 * and one reason to fail. In a large and complicated code base, tests that honor the single
 * responsibility principle are much easier to troubleshoot.
