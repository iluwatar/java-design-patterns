## Intent of Arrange/Act/Assert Design Pattern

The Arrange/Act/Assert pattern is essential in unit testing in Java. This testing method structures unit tests clearly by dividing them into three distinct sections: setup (Arrange), execution (Act), and verification (Assert).

## Detailed Explanation of Arrange/Act/Assert Pattern with Real-World Examples

Real-world example

> Imagine you are organizing a small event. To ensure everything runs smoothly, you follow a pattern similar to Arrange/Act/Assert:
>
> 1. **Arrange**: You set up the venue, prepare the guest list, arrange seating, and organize the catering.
> 2. **Act**: You conduct the event according to the plan, welcoming guests, serving food, and following the schedule.
> 3. **Assert**: After the event, you evaluate its success by checking guest feedback, ensuring all tasks were completed, and reviewing if everything went as planned.
>
> This clear separation of preparation, execution, and evaluation helps ensure the event is well-organized and successful, mirroring the structured approach of the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern in software testing.

In plain words

> Arrange/Act/Assert is a testing pattern that organizes tests into three clear steps for easy maintenance.

WikiWikiWeb says

> Arrange/Act/Assert is a pattern for arranging and formatting code in UnitTest methods.

## Programmatic Example of Arrange/Act/Assert Pattern in Java

We need to write comprehensive and clear unit test suite for a class. Using the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern in Java testing ensures clarity.

Let's first introduce our `Cash` class to be unit tested.

```java
public class Cash {

    private int amount;

    Cash(int amount) {
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    void plus(int addend) {
        amount += addend;
    }

    boolean minus(int subtrahend) {
        if (amount >= subtrahend) {
            amount -= subtrahend;
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

    int count() {
        return amount;
    }
}
```

Then we write our unit tests according to Arrange/Act/Assert pattern. Notice the clearly separated steps for each unit test.

```java
class CashAAATest {

    @Test
    void testPlus() {
        //Arrange
        var cash = new Cash(3);
        //Act
        cash.plus(4);
        //Assert
        assertEquals(7, cash.count());
    }

    @Test
    void testMinus() {
        //Arrange
        var cash = new Cash(8);
        //Act
        var result = cash.minus(5);
        //Assert
        assertTrue(result);
        assertEquals(3, cash.count());
    }

    @Test
    void testInsufficientMinus() {
        //Arrange
        var cash = new Cash(1);
        //Act
        var result = cash.minus(6);
        //Assert
        assertFalse(result);
        assertEquals(1, cash.count());
    }

    @Test
    void testUpdate() {
        //Arrange
        var cash = new Cash(5);
        //Act
        cash.plus(6);
        var result = cash.minus(3);
        //Assert
        assertTrue(result);
        assertEquals(8, cash.count());
    }
}
```

## When to Use the Arrange/Act/Assert Pattern in Java

Use Arrange/Act/Assert pattern when

* Unit testing, especially within the context of TDD and BDD
* Anywhere clarity and structure are needed in test cases

## Real-World Applications of Arrange/Act/Assert Pattern in Java

* This pattern is particularly useful when practicing TDD and/or BDD methodologies in Java.
* Utilized in various programming languages and testing frameworks, such as JUnit (Java), NUnit (.NET), and xUnit frameworks.

## Benefits and Trade-offs of Arrange/Act/Assert Pattern

Benefits:

* Improved readability of tests by clearly separating the setup, action, and verification steps.
* Easier maintenance and understanding of tests, as each test is structured in a predictable way.
* Facilitates debugging by isolating test failures to specific phases within the test.

Trade-offs:

* May introduce redundancy in tests, as similar arrangements may be repeated across tests.
* Some complex tests might not fit neatly into this structure, requiring additional context or setup outside these three phases.
