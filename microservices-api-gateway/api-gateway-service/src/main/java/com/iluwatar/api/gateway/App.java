/**
 * With the Microservices pattern, a client may need data from multiple different microservices. If
 * the client called each microservice directly, that could contribute to longer load times, since
 * the client would have to make a network request for each microservice called. Moreover, having
 * the client call each microservice directly ties the client to that microservice - if the internal
 * implementations of the microservices change (for example, if two microservices are combined
 * sometime in the future) or if the location (host and port) of a microservice changes, then every
 * client that makes use of those microservices must be updated.
 *
 * <p>The intent of the API Gateway pattern is to alleviate some of these issues. In the API Gateway
 * pattern, an additional entity (the API Gateway) is placed between the client and the
 * microservices. The job of the API Gateway is to aggregate the calls to the microservices. Rather
 * than the client calling each microservice individually, the client calls the API Gateway a single
 * time. The API Gateway then calls each of the microservices that the client needs.
 *
 * <p>This implementation shows what the API Gateway pattern could look like for an e-commerce site.
 * The {@link ApiGateway} makes calls to the Image and Price microservices using the {@link
 * ImageClientImpl} and {@link PriceClientImpl} respectively. Customers viewing the site on a
 * desktop device can see both price information and an image of a product, so the {@link
 * ApiGateway} calls both of the microservices and aggregates the data in the {@link DesktopProduct}
 * model. However, mobile users only see price information; they do not see a product image. For
 * mobile users, the {@link ApiGateway} only retrieves price information, which it uses to populate
 * the {@link MobileProduct}.
