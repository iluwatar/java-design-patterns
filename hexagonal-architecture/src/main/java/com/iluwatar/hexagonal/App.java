/**
 * Hexagonal Architecture pattern decouples the application core from the services it uses. This
 * allows the services to be plugged in and the application will run with or without the services.
 *
 * <p>The core logic, or business logic, of an application consists of the algorithms that are
 * essential to its purpose. They implement the use cases that are the heart of the application.
 * When you change them, you change the essence of the application.
 *
 * <p>The services are not essential. They can be replaced without changing the purpose of the
 * application. Examples: database access and other types of storage, user interface components,
 * e-mail and other communication components, hardware devices.
 *
 * <p>This example demonstrates Hexagonal Architecture with a lottery system. The application core
 * is separate from the services that drive it and from the services it uses.
 *
 * <p>The primary ports for the application are console interfaces {@link
 * com.iluwatar.hexagonal.administration.ConsoleAdministration} through which the lottery round is
 * initiated and run and {@link com.iluwatar.hexagonal.service.ConsoleLottery} that allows players
 * to submit lottery tickets for the draw.
 *
 * <p>The secondary ports that application core uses are{@link
 * com.iluwatar.hexagonal.banking.WireTransfers} which is a banking service, {@link
 * com.iluwatar.hexagonal.eventlog.LotteryEventLog} that delivers eventlog as lottery events occur
 * and {@link com.iluwatar.hexagonal.database.LotteryTicketRepository} that is the storage for the
 * lottery tickets.
