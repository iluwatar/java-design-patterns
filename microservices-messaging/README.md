## Intent of Microservices Messaging Design Pattern

The Microservices Messaging pattern enables asynchronous communication between microservices through message passing, allowing for better decoupling, scalability, and fault tolerance. Services communicate by exchanging messages over messaging channels managed by a message broker.
