/**
 * In the context object pattern, information and data from underlying protocol-specific

 * format. The pattern ensures the data contained within the context object can be shared and
 * further structured between different layers of a software system.
 *
 * <p>In this example we show how a context object {@link ServiceContext} can be initiated, edited
 * and passed/retrieved in different layers of the program ({@link LayerA}, {@link LayerB}, {@link
