/**
 * This application demonstrates the <b>Dirty Flag</b> pattern. The dirty flag behavioral pattern
 * allows you to avoid expensive operations that would just need to be done again anyway. This is a
 * simple pattern that really just explains how to add a bool value to your class that you can set
 * anytime a property changes. This will let your class know that any results it may have previously
 * calculated will need to be calculated again when they’re requested. Once the results are
 * re-calculated, then the bool value can be cleared.
 *
 * <p>There are some points that need to be considered before diving into using this pattern:- there
 * are some things you’ll need to consider:- (1) Do you need it? This design pattern works well when
 * the results to be calculated are difficult or resource intensive to compute. You want to save
 * them. You also don’t want to be calculating them several times in a row when only the last one
 * counts. (2) When do you set the dirty flag? Make sure that you set the dirty flag within the
 * class itself whenever an important property changes. This property should affect the result of
 * the calculated result and by changing the property, that makes the last result invalid. (3) When
 * do you clear the dirty flag? It might seem obvious that the dirty flag should be cleared whenever
 * the result is calculated with up-to-date information but there are other times when you might
 * want to clear the flag.
 *
 * <p>In this example, the {@link DataFetcher} holds the <i>dirty flag</i>. It fetches and
 * re-fetches from <i>world.txt</i> when needed. {@link World} mainly serves the data to the
 * front-end.
