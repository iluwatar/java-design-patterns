/**
 * In an application the Data Access Object (DAO) is a part of Data access layer. It is an object
 * that provides an interface to some type of persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls to
 * the persistence layer, DAO provides some specific data operations without exposing details of the
 * database. This isolation supports the Single responsibility principle. It separates what data
 * accesses the application needs, in terms of domain-specific objects and data types (the public
 * interface of the DAO), from how these needs can be satisfied with a specific DBMS, database
 * schema, etc.
 *
 * <p>Any change in the way data is stored and retrieved will not change the client code as the
 * client will be using interface and need not worry about exact source.
