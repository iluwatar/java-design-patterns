/**
 * The Front Controller is a presentation tier pattern. Essentially, it defines a controller that
 * handles all requests for a website.
 *
 * <p>The Front Controller pattern consolidates request handling through a single handler object (
 * {@link FrontController}). This object can carry out common behavior such as authorization,
 * request logging and routing requests to corresponding views.
 *
 * <p>Typically, the requests are mapped to command objects ({@link Command}) which then display the
 * correct view ({@link View}).
 *
 * <p>In this example we have implemented two views: {@link ArcherView} and {@link CatapultView}.
 * These are displayed by sending correct request to the {@link FrontController} object. For
 * example, the {@link ArcherView} gets displayed when {@link FrontController} receives request
 * "Archer". When the request is unknown, we display the error view ({@link ErrorView}).
