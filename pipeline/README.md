## Intent of Pipeline Design Pattern

The Pipeline design pattern in Java is engineered to facilitate data processing across discrete stages, enhancing modular development and operational efficiency.

## Detailed Explanation of Pipeline Pattern with Real-World Examples

Real-world example

> A practical example of the Java Pipeline design pattern can be seen in assembly lines, such as those in car manufacturing, illustrating its efficiency and scalability.
>
> In this analogy, the car manufacturing process is divided into several discrete stages, each stage handling a specific part of the car assembly. For example:
>
> 1. **Chassis Assembly:** The base frame of the car is assembled.
> 2. **Engine Installation:** The engine is installed onto the chassis.
> 3. **Painting:** The car is painted.
> 4. **Interior Assembly:** The interior, including seats and dashboard, is installed.
> 5. **Quality Control:** The finished car is inspected for defects.
>
> In the Java Pipeline pattern, each stage functions independently and sequentially, ensuring smooth data flow and easy modifications. The output of one stage (e.g., a partially assembled car) becomes the input for the next stage. This modular approach allows for easy maintenance, scalability (e.g., adding more workers to a stage), and flexibility (e.g., replacing a stage with a more advanced version). Just like in a software pipeline, changes in one stage do not affect the others, facilitating continuous improvements and efficient production.

In plain words

> Pipeline pattern is an assembly line where partial results are passed from one stage to another.

Wikipedia says

> In software engineering, a pipeline consists of a chain of processing elements (processes, threads, coroutines, functions, etc.), arranged so that the output of each element is the input of the next; the name is by analogy to a physical pipeline.

## Programmatic Example of Pipeline Pattern in Java

Let's create a string processing pipeline example. The stages of our pipeline are called `Handler`s.

```java
interface Handler<I, O> {
    O process(I input);
}
```

In our string processing example we have 3 different concrete `Handler`s.

```java
class RemoveAlphabetsHandler implements Handler<String, String> {
  // ...
}

class RemoveDigitsHandler implements Handler<String, String> {
  // ...
}

class ConvertToCharArrayHandler implements Handler<String, char[]> {
  // ...
}
```

Here is the `Pipeline` that will gather and execute the handlers one by one.

```java
class Pipeline<I, O> {

    private final Handler<I, O> currentHandler;

    Pipeline(Handler<I, O> currentHandler) {
        this.currentHandler = currentHandler;
    }

    <K> Pipeline<I, K> addHandler(Handler<O, K> newHandler) {
        return new Pipeline<>(input -> newHandler.process(currentHandler.process(input)));
    }

    O execute(I input) {
        return currentHandler.process(input);
    }
}
```

And here's the `Pipeline` in action processing the string.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    LOGGER.info("Creating pipeline");
    var filters = new Pipeline<>(new RemoveAlphabetsHandler())
            .addHandler(new RemoveDigitsHandler())
            .addHandler(new ConvertToCharArrayHandler());
    var input = "GoYankees123!";
    LOGGER.info("Executing pipeline with input: {}", input);
    var output = filters.execute(input);
    LOGGER.info("Pipeline output: {}", output);
}
```

Console output:

```
07:34:27.069 [main] INFO com.iluwatar.pipeline.App -- Creating pipeline
07:34:27.072 [main] INFO com.iluwatar.pipeline.App -- Executing pipeline with input: GoYankees123!

```

## When to Use the Pipeline Pattern in Java

Use the Pipeline pattern when you want to

* When you need to process data in a sequence of stages.
* When each stage of processing is independent and can be easily replaced or reordered.
* When you want to improve the scalability and maintainability of data processing code.

## Real-World Applications of Pipeline Pattern in Java

* Data transformation and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
* Compilers for processing source code through various stages such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation.
* Image processing applications where multiple filters are applied sequentially.
* Logging frameworks where messages pass through multiple handlers for formatting, filtering, and output.

## Benefits and Trade-offs of Pipeline Pattern

Benefits:

* Decoupling: Each stage of the pipeline is a separate component, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.
* Reusability: Individual stages can be reused in different pipelines.
* Extensibility: New stages can be added without modifying existing ones.
* Scalability: Pipelines can be parallelized by running different stages on different processors or threads.

Trade-offs:

* Complexity: Managing the flow of data through multiple stages can introduce complexity.
* Performance Overhead: Each stage introduces some performance overhead due to context switching and data transfer between stages.
* Debugging Difficulty: Debugging pipelines can be more challenging since the data flows through multiple components.

## Related Java Design Patterns

* [Chain of Responsibility](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/chain-of-responsibility/): Both patterns involve passing data through a series of handlers, but in Chain of Responsibility, handlers can decide not to pass the data further.
* [Decorator](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/decorator/): Both patterns involve adding behavior dynamically, but Decorator wraps additional behavior around objects, whereas Pipeline processes data in discrete steps.
* [Composite](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/composite/): Like Pipeline, Composite also involves hierarchical processing, but Composite is more about part-whole hierarchies.
