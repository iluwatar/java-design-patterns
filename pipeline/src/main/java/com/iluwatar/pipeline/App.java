     Suppose we wanted to pass through a String to a series of filtering stages and convert it
     as a char array on the last stage.

     - Stage handler 1 (pipe): Removing the alphabets, accepts a String input and returns the
     processed String output. This will be used by the next handler as its input.

     - Stage handler 2 (pipe): Removing the digits, accepts a String input and returns the
     processed String output. This shall also be used by the last handler we have.

     - Stage handler 3 (pipe): Converting the String input to a char array handler. We would
     be returning a different type in here since that is what's specified by the requirement.
     This means that at any stages along the pipeline, the handler can return any type of data
     as long as it fulfills the requirements for the next handler's input.

     Suppose we wanted to add another handler after ConvertToCharArrayHandler. That handler
     then is expected to receive an input of char[] array since that is the type being returned
     by the previous handler, ConvertToCharArrayHandler.
