/**
 * This application demonstrates Half-Sync/Half-Async pattern. Key parts of the pattern are {@link
 * AsyncTask} and {@link AsynchronousService}.
 *
 * <p><i>PROBLEM</i> <br>
 * A concurrent system have a mixture of short duration, mid-duration and long duration tasks. Mid
 * or long duration tasks should be performed asynchronously to meet quality of service
 * requirements.
 *
 * <p><i>INTENT</i> <br>
 * The intent of this pattern is to separate the synchronous and asynchronous processing in the
 * concurrent application by introducing two intercommunicating layers - one for sync and one for
 * async. This simplifies the programming without unduly affecting the performance.
 *
 * <p><i>APPLICABILITY</i> <br>
 * UNIX network subsystems - In operating systems network operations are carried out asynchronously
 * with help of hardware level interrupts.<br>
 * CORBA - At the asynchronous layer one thread is associated with each socket that is connected to
 * the client. Thread blocks waiting for CORBA requests from the client. On receiving request it is
 * inserted in the queuing layer which is then picked up by synchronous layer which processes the
 * request and sends response back to the client.<br>
 * Android AsyncTask framework - Framework provides a way to execute long-running blocking calls,
 * such as downloading a file, in background threads so that the UI thread remains free to respond
 * to user inputs.<br>
 *
 * <p><i>IMPLEMENTATION</i> <br>
 * The main method creates an asynchronous service which does not block the main thread while the
 * task is being performed. The main thread continues its work which is similar to Async Method
 * Invocation pattern. The difference between them is that there is a queuing layer between
 * Asynchronous layer and synchronous layer, which allows for different communication patterns
 * between both layers. Such as Priority Queue can be used as queuing layer to prioritize the way
 * tasks are executed. Our implementation is just one simple way of implementing this pattern, there
 * are many variants possible as described in its applications.
