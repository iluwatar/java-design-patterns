 * The Client-Session pattern allows the session data to be stored on the client side and send this
 * data to the server with each request.
 *
 * <p>In this example, The {@link Server} class represents the server that would process the
 * incoming {@link Request} and also assign {@link Session} to a client. Here one instance of Server
 * is created. The we create two sessions for two different clients. These sessions are then passed
 * on to the server in the request along with the data. The server is then able to interpret the
 * client based on the session associated with it.
