# Two-Step View


---

## Also known as

- Template View.
- Model-View Separation 
- Separated Presentation
- View Helper Pattern
---

## Intent of Two-Step View Design Pattern
- **Decouple Data and Presentation**: Separate data preparation from rendering for better modularity.
- **Reusable Rendering**: Use templates to reduce duplication.
- **Flexibility**: Render the same data differently with various templates.
- **Maintainability**: Simplify testing and updates by isolating logic.
- **Multi-Format Support**: Prepare data once and render in formats like HTML or JSON.

## Detailed Explanation of the Two Step View Pattern with Real-World Examples

**Real-World Example**:
Imagine a restaurant kitchen.

**Step 1**: Preparation – The chef cooks and plates the food, ensuring it is ready to be served.

**Step 2**: Presentation – The waiter serves the plated food to the customer, adding any final touches, such as garnishes.

**In Plain Words**: The Two-Step View Pattern separates the process of preparing data from how it is presented.

**Authoritative Source**: Martin Fowler describes the Two-Step View pattern as transforming domain data into HTML in two stages: first by creating a logical page, then rendering it into HTML.(https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/twoStepView.html)

## Programmatic Example of Two-Step View Pattern in Java


#### **Phase 1: Data Preparation (`DataPreparation`)**
- **Responsibility:** Processes raw `Book` data by calculating the discount price and checking stock availability.
- **Method:** `prepareBook(Book book)`
- **Output:** Returns a `BookStore` object with processed details.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  BookStore bookStore = DataPreparation.prepareBook(book);
  ```

#### **Phase 2: Presentation (`Presentation`)**
- **Responsibility:** Converts the prepared `BookStore` data into an HTML representation.
- **Method:** `presentBook(BookStore bookInStore)`
- **Output:** HTML formatted book details.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  String bookHtml = Presentation.presentBook(bookStore);
  ```

## When to Use the Two Step View Pattern in Java

- **Separation of Logic:** When you need to separate data preparation from presentation for better modularity.
- **Multiple Formats:** When the same data needs to be rendered in multiple formats (e.g., HTML, JSON, XML).
- **Reusable Templates:** When you want to reuse rendering logic across different parts of the application.
- **Maintainability:** When frequent changes in the presentation layer shouldn't impact the business logic or data preparation.
- **Flexibility:** When different rendering methods are required for the same prepared data based on user preferences or contexts.
- **Scalability:** When adding new presentation formats without affecting existing preparation logic is needed.
- **MVC Architecture:** When implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, where the model (data preparation) and view (presentation) are distinctly separate.
- **Testability:** When isolating and unit testing data preparation and rendering logic independently is a priority.

## Real-World Applications of Two-Step View Pattern in Java

- **Spring MVC**: Separates the logic of data preparation from view rendering, using technologies like JSP, Thymeleaf, or FreeMarker. ([Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58114790/spring-mvc-one-step-view-or-two-step-view))
- **Composite View Pattern**: Similar to Two Step View, this pattern involves composing view components into tree structures, promoting separation of concerns. ([Java Design Patterns - Composite View](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/composite-view/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Martin Fowler's Two Step View**: A foundational explanation of transforming domain data into HTML in two stages, applied in web applications. ([martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/twoStepView.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### **Benefits of the Two Step View Pattern**

- **Separation of Concerns:** Separates data processing from presentation logic, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.
- **Reusability:** Data preparation and presentation can be reused independently across different views or formats.
- **Flexibility:** Easily switch or modify the presentation layer (e.g., HTML, XML, JSON) without changing the underlying data logic.
- **Maintainability:** Changes in the data model or presentation logic are isolated, reducing the risk of side effects.
- **Testability:** Each phase (data preparation and rendering) can be unit tested independently, improving code quality and reliability.
- **Scalability:** Adding new views or presentation formats becomes easier without altering the core business logic.

## **Trade-offs of the Two Step View Pattern**

- **Increased Complexity:** Implementing two separate steps adds complexity, particularly in smaller applications where a simple approach may suffice.
- **Performance Overhead:** Dividing the logic into two phases may introduce unnecessary overhead, especially in performance-critical applications.
- **Over-engineering:** For simple applications, the pattern might be overkill, leading to unnecessary abstraction.
- **Tighter Coupling of Phases:** If not designed properly, the two phases (data preparation and presentation) might still become tightly coupled, reducing the pattern's effectiveness.
- **Development Time:** The initial implementation of two phases may require more time compared to simpler, more straightforward methods.
