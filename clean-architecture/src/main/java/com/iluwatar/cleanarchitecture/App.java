/**
 * Clean Architecture ensures separation of concerns by organizing code, into layers and making it
 * scalable and maintainable.
 *
 * <p>In the example there are Entities (Core Models) – Product, Cart, Order handle business logic.
 * Use Cases (Application Logic) – ShoppingCartService manages operations like adding items and
 * checkout. Interfaces & Adapters – Repositories (CartRepository, OrderRepository) abstract data
 * handling, while controllers (CartController, OrderController) manage interactions.
