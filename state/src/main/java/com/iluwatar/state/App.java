 * In the State pattern, the container object has an internal state object that defines the current
 * behavior. The state object can be changed to alter the behavior.
 *
 * <p>This can be a cleaner way for an object to change its behavior at runtime without resorting to
 * large monolithic conditional statements and thus improves maintainability.
 *
 * <p>In this example the {@link Mammoth} changes its behavior as time passes by.
