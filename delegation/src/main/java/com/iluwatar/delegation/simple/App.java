/**
 * The delegate pattern provides a mechanism to abstract away the implementation and control of the
 * desired action. The class being called in this case {@link PrinterController} is not responsible
 * for the actual desired action, but is actually delegated to a helper class either {@link
 * CanonPrinter}, {@link EpsonPrinter} or {@link HpPrinter}. The consumer does not have or require
 * knowledge of the actual class carrying out the action, only the container on which they are
 * calling.
 *
 * <p>In this example the delegates are {@link EpsonPrinter}, {@link HpPrinter} and {@link
 * CanonPrinter} they all implement {@link Printer}. The {@link PrinterController} class also
 * implements {@link Printer}. However, neither provide the functionality of {@link Printer} by
 * printing to the screen, they actually call upon the instance of {@link Printer} that they were
 * instantiated with. Therefore, delegating the behaviour to another class.
