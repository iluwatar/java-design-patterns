# Introduction

Design patterns are the best formalized practices a programmer can use to
solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven
development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns help prevent subtle issues that cause major
problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who
are familiar with the patterns.

# Getting started

This site showcases Java Design Patterns. The solutions have been developed by
experienced programmers and architects from the open source community. The 
patterns can be browsed by their high level descriptions or by looking at their
source code. The source code examples are well commented and can be thought as
programming tutorials how to implement a specific pattern. We use the most
popular battle-proven open source Java technologies.

Before you dive into the material, you should be familiar with various
[Software Design Principles](https://java-design-patterns.com/principles/).

All designs should be as simple as possible. You should start with KISS, YAGNI,
and Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work principles. Complexity and
patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for practical
extensibility.

Once you are familiar with these concepts you can start drilling down into the
[available design patterns](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/) by any 
of the following approaches

 - Search for a specific pattern by name. Can't find one? Please report a new pattern [here](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/issues).
 - Using tags such as `Performance`, `Gang of Four` or `Data access`.
 - Using pattern categories, `Creational`, `Behavioral`, and others.

Hopefully you find the object oriented solutions presented on this site useful
in your architectures and have as much fun learning them as we had developing them.
