/**
 * The syntax of Java language doesn’t allow you to declare a method with a predefined value for a
 * parameter. Probably the best option to achieve default method parameters in Java is by using the
 * method overloading. Method overloading allows you to declare several methods with the same name
 * but with a different number of parameters. But the main problem with method overloading as a
 * solution for default parameter values reveals itself when a method accepts multiple parameters.
 * Creating an overloaded method for each possible combination of parameters might be cumbersome. To
 * deal with this issue, the Parameter Object pattern is used. The Parameter Object is simply a
 * wrapper object for all parameters of a method. It is nothing more than just a regular POJO. The
 * advantage of the Parameter Object over a regular method parameter list is the fact that class
 * fields can have default values. Once the wrapper class is created for the method parameter list,
 * a corresponding builder class is also created. Usually it's an inner static class. The final step
 * is to use the builder to construct a new parameter object. For those parameters that are skipped,
 * their default values are going to be used.
