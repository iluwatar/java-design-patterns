/**
 * Domain Model pattern is a more complex solution for organizing domain logic than Transaction
 * Script and Table Module. It provides an object-oriented way of dealing with complicated logic.
 * Instead of having one procedure that handles all business logic for a user action like
 * Transaction Script there are multiple objects and each of them handles a slice of domain logic
 * that is relevant to it. The significant difference between Domain Model and Table Module pattern
 * is that in Table Module a single class encapsulates all the domain logic for all records stored
 * in table when in Domain Model every single class represents only one record in underlying table.
 *
 * <p>In this example, we will use the Domain Model pattern to implement buying of products by
 * customers in a Shop. The main method will create a customer and a few products. Customer will do
 * a few purchases, try to buy product which are too expensive for him, return product which he
 * bought to return money.
