/**
 * the Gateway design pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a unified interface to a
 * set of interfaces in a subsystem. It involves creating a Gateway interface that serves as a
 * common entry point for interacting with various services, and concrete implementations of this
 * interface for different external services.
 *
 * <p>In this example, GateFactory is the factory class, and it provides a method to create
 * different kinds of external services. ExternalServiceA, B, and C are virtual implementations of
 * the external services. Each service provides its own implementation of the execute() method. The
 * Gateway interface is the common interface for all external services. The App class serves as the
 * main entry point for the application implementing the Gateway design pattern. Through the Gateway
 * interface, the App class could call each service with much less complexity.
