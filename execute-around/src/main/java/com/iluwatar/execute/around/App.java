/**
 * The Execute Around idiom specifies executable code before and after a method. Typically, the
 * idiom is used when the API has methods to be executed in pairs, such as resource
 * allocation/deallocation or lock acquisition/release.
 *
 * <p>In this example, we have {@link SimpleFileWriter} class that opens and closes the file for the
 * user. The user specifies only what to do with the file by providing the {@link FileWriterAction}
 * implementation.
