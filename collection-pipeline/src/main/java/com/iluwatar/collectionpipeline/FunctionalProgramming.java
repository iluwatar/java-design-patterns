/**
 * Iterating and sorting with a collection pipeline
 *
 * <p>In functional programming, it's common to sequence complex operations through a series of
 * smaller modular functions or operations. The series is called a composition of functions, or a
 * function composition. When a collection of data flows through a function composition, it becomes
 * a collection pipeline. Function Composition and Collection Pipeline are two design patterns
 * frequently used in functional-style programming.
 *
 * <p>Instead of passing a lambda expression to the map method, we passed the method reference
 * Car::getModel. Likewise, instead of passing the lambda expression car -> car.getYear() to the
 * comparing method, we passed the method reference Car::getYear. Method references are short,
 * concise, and expressive. It is best to use them wherever possible.
