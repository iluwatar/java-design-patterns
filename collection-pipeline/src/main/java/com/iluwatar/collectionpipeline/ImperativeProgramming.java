/**
 * Imperative-style programming to iterate over the list and get the names of cars made later than
 * the year 2000. We then sort the models in ascending order by year.
 *
 * <p>As you can see, there's a lot of looping in this code. First, the getModelsAfter2000UsingFor
 * method takes a list of cars as its parameter. It extracts or filters out cars made after the year
 * 2000, putting them into a new list named carsSortedByYear. Next, it sorts that list in ascending
 * order by year-of-make. Finally, it loops through the list carsSortedByYear to get the model names
 * and returns them in a list.
 *
 * <p>This short example demonstrates what I call the effect of statements. While functions and
 * methods in general can be used as expressions, the {@link Collections} sort method doesn't return
 * a result. Because it is used as a statement, it mutates the list given as argument. Both of the
 * for loops also mutate lists as they iterate. Being statements, that's just how these elements
 * work. As a result, the code contains unnecessary garbage variables
