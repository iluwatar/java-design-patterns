/**
 * The Abstract Factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that
 * have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes. In normal usage, the client
 * software creates a concrete implementation of the abstract factory and then uses the generic
 * interface of the factory to create the concrete objects that are part of the theme. The client
 * does not know (or care) which concrete objects it gets from each of these internal factories,
 * since it uses only the generic interfaces of their products. This pattern separates the details
 * of implementation of a set of objects from their general usage and relies on object composition,
 * as object creation is implemented in methods exposed in the factory interface.
 *
 * <p>The essence of the Abstract Factory pattern is a factory interface ({@link KingdomFactory})
 * and its implementations ( {@link ElfKingdomFactory}, {@link OrcKingdomFactory}). The example uses
 * both concrete implementations to create a king, a castle and an army.
