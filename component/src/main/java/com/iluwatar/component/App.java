/**
 * The component design pattern is a common game design structure. This pattern is often used to
 * reduce duplication of code as well as to improve maintainability. In this implementation,
 * component design pattern has been used to provide two game objects with varying component
 * interfaces (features). As opposed to copying and pasting same code for the two game objects, the
 * component interfaces allow game objects to inherit these components from the component classes.
 *
 * <p>The implementation has decoupled graphic, physics and input components from the player and NPC
 * objects. As a result, it avoids the creation of monolithic java classes.
 *
 * <p>The below example in this App class demonstrates the use of the component interfaces for
 * separate objects (player & NPC) and updating of these components as per the implementations in
 * GameObject class and the component classes.
