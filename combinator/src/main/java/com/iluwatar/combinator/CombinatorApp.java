 * various ways to build up more complex values of type T. The class {@link Finder} defines a simple
 * function {@link Finder#find(String)} and connected functions {@link Finder#or(Finder)}, {@link
 * Finder#not(Finder)}, {@link Finder#and(Finder)} Using them the became possible to get more

            By the name of ANNABEL LEE;

            Than to love and be loved by me.

            In this kingdom by the sea;

            With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
            Coveted her and me.""";
