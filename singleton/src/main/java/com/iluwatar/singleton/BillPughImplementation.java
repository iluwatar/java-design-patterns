 * Java memory model's guarantees about class initialization. Each class is
 * initialized only once, when it is first used. If the class hasn't been used
 * yet, it won't be loaded into memory, and no memory will be allocated for
 * a static instance. This makes the singleton instance lazy-loaded and thread-safe.</p>
