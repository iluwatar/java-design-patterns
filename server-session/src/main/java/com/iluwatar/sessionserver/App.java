/**
 * The server session pattern is a behavioral design pattern concerned with assigning the
 * responsibility of storing session data on the server side. Within the context of stateless
 * protocols like HTTP all requests are isolated events independent of previous requests. In order
 * to create sessions during user-access for a particular web application various methods can be
 * used, such as cookies. Cookies are a small piece of data that can be sent between client and
 * server on every request and response so that the server can "remember" the previous requests. In
 * general cookies can either store the session data or the cookie can store a session identifier
 * and be used to access appropriate data from a persistent storage. In the latter case the session
 * data is stored on the server-side and appropriate data is identified by the cookie sent from a
 * client's request. This project demonstrates the latter case. In the following example the ({@link
 * App}) class starts a server and assigns ({@link LoginHandler}) class to handle login request.
 * When a user logs in a session identifier is created and stored for future requests in a list.
 * When a user logs out the session identifier is deleted from the list along with the appropriate
 * user session data, which is handle by the ({@link LogoutHandler}) class.
