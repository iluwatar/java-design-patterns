/**
 * Transaction Script (TS) is one of the simplest domain logic pattern. It needs less work to
 * implement than other domain logic patterns, and therefore it’s perfect fit for smaller
 * applications that don't need big architecture behind them.
 *
 * <p>In this example we will use the TS pattern to implement booking and cancellation methods for a
 * Hotel management App. The main method will initialise an instance of {@link Hotel} and add rooms
 * to it. After that it will book and cancel a couple of rooms and that will be printed by the
 * logger.
 *
 * <p>The thing we have to note here is that all the operations related to booking or cancelling a
 * room like checking the database if the room exists, checking the booking status or the room,
 * calculating refund price are all clubbed inside a single transaction script method.
