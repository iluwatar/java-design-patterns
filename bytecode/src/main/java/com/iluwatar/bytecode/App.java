/**
 * The intention of Bytecode pattern is to give behavior the flexibility of data by encoding it as
 * instructions for a virtual machine. An instruction set defines the low-level operations that can
 * be performed. A series of instructions is encoded as a sequence of bytes. A virtual machine
 * executes these instructions one at a time, using a stack for intermediate values. By combining
 * instructions, complex high-level behavior can be defined.
 *
 * <p>This pattern should be used when there is a need to define high number of behaviours and
 * implementation engine is not a good choice because It is too lowe level Iterating on it takes too
 * long due to slow compile times or other tooling issues. It has too much trust. If you want to
 * ensure the behavior being defined can’t break the game, you need to sandbox it from the rest of
 * the codebase.
