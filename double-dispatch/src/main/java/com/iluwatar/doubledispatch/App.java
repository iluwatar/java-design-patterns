/**
 * When a message with a parameter is sent to an object, the resultant behaviour is defined by the
 * implementation of that method in the receiver. Sometimes the behaviour must also be determined by
 * the type of the parameter.
 *
 * <p>One way to implement this would be to create multiple instanceof-checks for the methods
 * parameter. However, this creates a maintenance issue. When new types are added we would also need
 * to change the method's implementation and add a new instanceof-check. This violates the single
 * responsibility principle - a class should have only one reason to change.
 *
 * <p>Instead of the instanceof-checks a better way is to make another virtual call on the parameter
 * object. This way new functionality can be easily added without the need to modify existing
 * implementation (open-closed principle).
 *
 * <p>In this example we have hierarchy of objects ({@link GameObject}) that can collide to each
 * other. Each object has its own coordinates which are checked against the other objects'
 * coordinates. If there is an overlap, then the objects collide utilizing the Double Dispatch
 * pattern.
