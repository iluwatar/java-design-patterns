/**
 * The Monad pattern defines a monad structure, that enables chaining operations in pipelines and
 * processing data step by step. Formally, monad consists of a type constructor M and two
 * operations: <br>
 * bind - that takes monadic object and a function from plain object to the monadic value and
 * returns monadic value. <br>
 * return - that takes plain type object and returns this object wrapped in a monadic value.
 *
 * <p>In the given example, the Monad pattern is represented as a {@link Validator} that takes an
 * instance of a plain object with {@link Validator#of(Object)} and validates it {@link
 * Validator#validate(Function, Predicate, String)} against given predicates.
 *
 * <p>As a validation result {@link Validator#get()} either returns valid object or throws {@link
 * IllegalStateException} with list of exceptions collected during validation.
