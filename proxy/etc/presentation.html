# Proxy

---

# Also known as

* Surrogate

---

# Intent

* Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

---

# Applicability

* Protection proxy limits access to the real subject.
* Virtual proxies are used when an object is expensive to instantiate.
* Caching proxies are used to cache expensive calls to the real subject.
* Remote proxies are used in distributed object communication.
* Smart proxies are used to implement reference counting and log calls to the object.
