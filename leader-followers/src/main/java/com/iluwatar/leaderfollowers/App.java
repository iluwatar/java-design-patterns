/**
 * Leader/Followers pattern is a concurrency pattern. This pattern behaves like a taxi stand where
 * one of the threads acts as leader thread which listens for event from event sources,
 * de-multiplexes, dispatches and handles the event. It promotes the follower to be the new leader.
 * When processing completes the thread joins the followers queue, if there are no followers then it
 * becomes the leader and cycle repeats again.
 *
 * <p>In this example, one of the workers becomes Leader and listens on the {@link TaskSet} for
 * work. {@link TaskSet} basically acts as the source of input events for the {@link Worker}, who
 * are spawned and controlled by the {@link WorkCenter} . When {@link Task} arrives then the leader
 * takes the work and calls the {@link TaskHandler}. It also calls the {@link WorkCenter} to
 * promotes one of the followers to be the new leader, who can then process the next work and so on.
 *
 * <p>The pros for this pattern are: It enhances CPU cache affinity and eliminates unbound
 * allocation and data buffer sharing between threads by reading the request into buffer space
 * allocated on the stack of the leader or by using the Thread-Specific Storage pattern [22] to
 * allocate memory. It minimizes locking overhead by not exchanging data between threads, thereby
 * reducing thread synchronization. In bound handle/thread associations, the leader thread
 * dispatches the event based on the I/O handle. It can minimize priority inversion because no extra
 * queuing is introduced in the server. It does not require a context switch to handle each event,
 * reducing the event dispatching latency. Note that promoting a follower thread to fulfill the
 * leader role requires a context switch. Programming simplicity: The Leader/Followers pattern
 * simplifies the programming of concurrency models where multiple threads can receive requests,
 * process responses, and de-multiplex connections using a shared handle set.
