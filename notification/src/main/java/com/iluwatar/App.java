 * The notification pattern captures information passed between layers, validates the information,
 * and returns any errors to the presentation layer if needed.
 *
 * <p>In this code, this pattern is implemented through the example of a form being submitted to
 * register a worker. The worker inputs their name, occupation, and date of birth to the
 * RegisterWorkerForm (which acts as our presentation layer), and passes it to the RegisterWorker
 * class (our domain layer) which validates it. Any errors caught by the domain layer are then
 * passed back to the presentation layer through the RegisterWorkerDto.
