/**
 * The MonoState pattern ensures that all instances of the class will have the same state. This can
 * be used a direct replacement of the Singleton pattern.
 *
 * <p>In the following example, The {@link LoadBalancer} class represents the app's logic. It
 * contains a series of Servers, which can handle requests of type {@link Request}. Two instances of
 * LoadBalancer are created. When a request is made to a server via the first LoadBalancer the state
 * change in the first load balancer affects the second. So if the first LoadBalancer selects the
 * Server 1, the second LoadBalancer on a new request will select the Second server. If a third
 * LoadBalancer is created and a new request is made to it, then it will select the third server as
 * the second load balancer has already selected the second server.
