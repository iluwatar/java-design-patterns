/**
 * The Caching pattern describes how to avoid expensive re-acquisition of
 * resources by not releasing the resources immediately after their use.
 * The resources retain their identity, are kept in some fast-access storage,
 * and are re-used to avoid having to acquire them again. There are four main
 * caching strategies/techniques in this pattern; each with their own pros and
 * cons. They are <code>write-through</code> which writes data to the cache and
 * DB in a single transaction, <code>write-around</code> which writes data
 * immediately into the DB instead of the cache, <code>write-behind</code>
 * which writes data into the cache initially whilst the data is only
 * written into the DB when the cache is full, and <code>cache-aside</code>
 * which pushes the responsibility of keeping the data synchronized in both
 * data sources to the application itself. The <code>read-through</code>
 * strategy is also included in the mentioned four strategies --
 * returns data from the cache to the caller <b>if</b> it exists <b>else</b>
 * queries from DB and stores it into the cache for future use. These strategies
 * determine when the data in the cache should be written back to the backing
 * store (i.e. Database) and help keep both data sources
 * synchronized/up-to-date. This pattern can improve performance and also helps
 * to maintainconsistency between data held in the cache and the data in
 * the underlying data store.
 *
 * <p>In this example, the user account ({@link UserAccount}) entity is used
 * as the underlying application data. The cache itself is implemented as an
 * internal (Java) data structure. It adopts a Least-Recently-Used (LRU)
 * strategy for evicting data from itself when its full. The four
 * strategies are individually tested. The testing of the cache is restricted
 * towards saving and querying of user accounts from the
 * underlying data store( {@link DbManager}). The main class ( {@link App}
 * is not aware of the underlying mechanics of the application
 * (i.e. save and query) and whether the data is coming from the cache or the
 * DB (i.e. separation of concern). The AppManager ({@link AppManager}) handles
 * the transaction of data to-and-from the underlying data store (depending on
 * the preferred caching policy/strategy).
 * <p>
 * <i>{@literal App --> AppManager --> CacheStore/LRUCache/CachingPolicy -->
 * DBManager} </i>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There are 2 ways to launch the application.
 *  - to use "in Memory" database.
 *  - to use the MongoDb as a database
 *
 * To run the application with "in Memory" database, just launch it without parameters
 * Example: 'java -jar app.jar'
 *
 * To run the application with MongoDb you need to be installed the MongoDb
 * in your system, or to launch it in the docker container.
 * You may launch docker container from the root of current module with command:
 * 'docker-compose up'
 * Then you can start the application with parameter --mongo
 * Example: 'java -jar app.jar --mongo'
 * </p>
