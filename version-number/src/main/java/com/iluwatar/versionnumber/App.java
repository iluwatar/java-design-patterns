/**
 * The Version Number pattern helps to resolve concurrency conflicts in applications. Usually these
 * conflicts arise in database operations, when multiple clients are trying to update the same
 * record simultaneously. Resolving such conflicts requires determining whether an object has
 * changed. For this reason we need a version number that is incremented with each change to the
 * underlying data, e.g. database. The version number can be used by repositories to check for
 * external changes and to report concurrency issues to the users.
 *
 * <p>In this example we show how Alice and Bob will try to update the {@link Book} and save it
 * simultaneously to {@link BookRepository}, which represents a typical database.
 *
 * <p>As in real databases, each client operates with copy of the data instead of original data
 * passed by reference, that's why we are using {@link Book} copy-constructor here.
