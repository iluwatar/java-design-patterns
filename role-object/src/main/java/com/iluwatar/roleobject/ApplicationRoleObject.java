/**
 * The Role Object pattern suggests to model context-specific views of an object as separate role
 * objects which are dynamically attached to and removed from the core object. We call the resulting
 * composite object structure, consisting of the core and its role objects, a subject. A subject
 * often plays several roles and the same role is likely to be played by different subjects. As an
 * example consider two different customers playing the role of borrower and investor, respectively.
 * Both roles could as well be played by a single {@link Customer} object. The common superclass for
 * customer-specific roles is provided by {@link CustomerRole}, which also supports the {@link
 * Customer} interface.
 *
 * <p>The {@link CustomerRole} class is abstract and not meant to be instantiated. Concrete
 * subclasses of {@link CustomerRole}, for example {@link BorrowerRole} or {@link InvestorRole},
 * define and implement the interface for specific roles. It is only these subclasses which are
 * instantiated at runtime. The {@link BorrowerRole} class defines the context-specific view of
 * {@link Customer} objects as needed by the loan department. It defines additional operations to
 * manage the customer’s credits and securities. Similarly, the {@link InvestorRole} class adds
 * operations specific to the investment department’s view of customers. A client like the loan
 * application may either work with objects of the {@link CustomerRole} class, using the interface
 * class {@link Customer}, or with objects of concrete {@link CustomerRole} subclasses. Suppose the
 * loan application knows a particular {@link Customer} instance through its {@link Customer}
 * interface. The loan application may want to check whether the {@link Customer} object plays the
 * role of Borrower. To this end it calls {@link Customer#hasRole(Role)} with a suitable role
 * specification. For the purpose of our example, let’s assume we can name roles with enum. If the
 * {@link Customer} object can play the role named “Borrower,” the loan application will ask it to
 * return a reference to the corresponding object. The loan application may now use this reference
 * to call Borrower-specific operations.
