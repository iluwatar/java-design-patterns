/**
 * The ambassador pattern creates a helper service that sends network requests on behalf of a
 * client. It is often used in cloud-based applications to offload features of a remote service.
 *
 * <p>An ambassador service can be thought of as an out-of-process proxy that is co-located with the
 * client. Similar to the proxy design pattern, the ambassador service provides an interface for
 * another remote service. In addition to the interface, the ambassador provides extra functionality
 * and features, specifically offloaded common connectivity tasks. This usually consists of
 * monitoring, logging, routing, security etc. This is extremely useful in legacy applications where
 * the codebase is difficult to modify and allows for improvements in the application's networking
 * capabilities.
 *
 * <p>In this example, we will the ({@link ServiceAmbassador}) class represents the ambassador while
 * the ({@link RemoteService}) class represents a remote application.
