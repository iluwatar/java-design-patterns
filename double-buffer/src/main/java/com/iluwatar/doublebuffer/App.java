/**
 * Double buffering is a term used to describe a device that has two buffers. The usage of multiple
 * buffers increases the overall throughput of a device and helps prevents bottlenecks. This example
 * shows using double buffer pattern on graphics. It is used to show one image or frame while a
 * separate frame is being buffered to be shown next. This method makes animations and games look
 * more realistic than the same done in a single buffer mode.
