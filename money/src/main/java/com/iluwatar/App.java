/**
 * The `App` class demonstrates the functionality of the {@link Money} class, which encapsulates
 * monetary values and their associated currencies. It showcases operations like addition,
 * subtraction, multiplication, and currency conversion, while ensuring validation and immutability.
 *
 * <p>Through this example, the handling of invalid operations (e.g., mismatched currencies or
 * invalid inputs) is demonstrated using custom exceptions. Logging is used for transparency.
 *
 * <p>This highlights the practical application of object-oriented principles such as encapsulation
 * and validation in a financial context.
