/**
 * The Active Object pattern helps to solve synchronization difficulties without using

 * BlockingQueue) and use to synchronize method calls by moving the logic of the method into an
 * invocator(usually a Runnable) and store it in the DSA.
 *
 * <p>In this example, we fire 20 threads to modify a value in the target class.
