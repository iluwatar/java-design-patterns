/**
 * A Service Stub is a dummy implementation of an external service used during development or
 * testing. The purpose is to provide a lightweight "stub" when the real service may not always be
 * available (or too slow to use during testing).
 *
 * <p>This implementation simulates a simple sentiment analysis program, where a text is analyzed to
 * deduce whether it is a positive, negative or neutral sentiment. The stub returns a response based
 * on whether the analyzed text contains the words "good" or "bad", not accounting for stopwords or
 * the underlying semantic of the text.
 *
 * <p>The "real" sentiment analysis class simulates the processing time for the request by pausing
 * the execution of the thread for 5 seconds. In the stub sentiment analysis class the response is
 * immediate. In addition, the stub returns a deterministic output with regard to the input. This is
 * extra useful for testing purposes.
