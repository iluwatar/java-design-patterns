/**
 * A Value Object are objects which follow value semantics rather than reference semantics. This
 * means value objects' equality are not based on identity. Two value objects are equal when they
 * have the same value, not necessarily being the same object.
 *
 * <p>Value Objects must override equals(), hashCode() to check the equality with values. Value
 * Objects should be immutable so declare members final. Obtain instances by static factory methods.
 * The elements of the state must be other values, including primitive types. Provide methods,
 * typically simple getters, to get the elements of the state. A Value Object must check equality
 * with equals() not ==
 *
 * <p>For more specific and strict rules to implement value objects check the rules from Stephen
 * Colebourne's term VALJO : http://blog.joda.org/2014/03/valjos-value-java-objects.html
