/**
 * Producer Consumer Design pattern is a classic concurrency or threading pattern which reduces
 * coupling between Producer and Consumer by separating Identification of work with Execution of
 * Work.
 *
 * <p>In producer consumer design pattern a shared queue is used to control the flow and this
 * separation allows you to code producer and consumer separately. It also addresses the issue of
 * different timing require to produce item or consuming item. by using producer consumer pattern
 * both Producer and Consumer Thread can work with different speed.
