/**
 * Event or message queues provide an asynchronous communications protocol, meaning that the sender
 * and receiver of the message do not need to interact with the message queue at the same time.
 * Events or messages placed onto the queue are stored until the recipient retrieves them. Event or
 * message queues have implicit or explicit limits on the size of data that may be transmitted in a
 * single message and the number of messages that may remain outstanding on the queue. A queue
 * stores a series of notifications or requests in first-in, first-out order. Sending a notification
 * enqueues the request and returns. The request processor then processes items from the queue at a
 * later time.
