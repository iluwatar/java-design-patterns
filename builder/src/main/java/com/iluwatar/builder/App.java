/**
 * The intention of the Builder pattern is to find a solution to the telescoping constructor
 * antipattern. The telescoping constructor antipattern occurs when the increase of object
 * constructor parameter combination leads to an exponential list of constructors. Instead of using
 * numerous constructors, the builder pattern uses another object, a builder, that receives each
 * initialization parameter step by step and then returns the resulting constructed object at once.
 *
 * <p>The Builder pattern has another benefit. It can be used for objects that contain flat data
 * (html code, SQL query, X.509 certificate...), that is to say, data that can't be easily edited.
 * This type of data cannot be edited step by step and must be edited at once. The best way to
 * construct such an object is to use a builder class.
 *
 * <p>In this example we have the Builder pattern variation as described by Joshua Bloch in
 * Effective Java 2nd Edition.
 *
 * <p>We want to build {@link Hero} objects, but its construction is complex because of the many
 * parameters needed. To aid the user we introduce {@link Builder} class. {@link Hero.Builder} takes
 * the minimum parameters to build {@link Hero} object in its constructor. After that additional
 * configuration for the {@link Hero} object can be done using the fluent {@link Builder} interface.
 * When configuration is ready the build method is called to receive the final {@link Hero} object.
