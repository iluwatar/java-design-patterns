/**
 * One of the possible approaches to terminate Producer-Consumer pattern is using the Poison Pill
 * idiom. If you use Poison Pill as the termination signal then Producer is responsible to notify
 * Consumer that the exchange is over and reject any further messages. The Consumer receiving Poison
 * Pill will stop reading messages from the queue. You must also ensure that the Poison Pill will be
 * the last message that will be read from the queue (if you have prioritized queue then this can be
 * tricky).
 *
 * <p>In simple cases the Poison Pill can be just a null-reference, but holding a unique separate
 * shared object-marker (with name "Poison" or "Poison Pill") is more clear and self describing.
