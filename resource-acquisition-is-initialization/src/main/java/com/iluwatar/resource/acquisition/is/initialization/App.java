/**
 * Resource Acquisition Is Initialization pattern was developed for exception safe resource
 * management by C++ creator Bjarne Stroustrup.
 *
 * <p>In RAII resource is tied to object lifetime: resource allocation is done during object
 * creation while resource deallocation is done during object destruction.
 *
 * <p>In Java RAII is achieved with try-with-resources statement and interfaces {@link
 * java.io.Closeable} and {@link AutoCloseable}. The try-with-resources statement ensures that each
 * resource is closed at the end of the statement. Any object that implements {@link
 * java.lang.AutoCloseable}, which includes all objects which implement {@link java.io.Closeable},
 * can be used as a resource.
 *
 * <p>In this example, {@link SlidingDoor} implements {@link AutoCloseable} and {@link
 * TreasureChest} implements {@link java.io.Closeable}. Running the example, we can observe that
 * both resources are automatically closed.
