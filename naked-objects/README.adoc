This is a simple link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis] application, structured so it can be used as a starting point for developing your own applications.

[TIP]
====
If all you want is get a feel for what the framework is all about, then take a look at the link:https://github.com/apache/isis-app-helloworld[HelloWorld] starter app, which is even simpler.

== Quick start

* install prereqs:

** Java 8 LTS (eg link:https://adoptopenjdk.net/[Adopt OpenJDK] distribution)
** Maven 3.6 or later (http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[download])
* download and unzip
+
[source,bash]
----
APP=simpleapp
BRANCH=master

REPO=isis-app-$APP
curl "https://codeload.github.com/apache/$REPO/zip/$BRANCH" | jar xv
mv $REPO-$BRANCH $REPO
cd $REPO
----

* Build using Maven:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

* Run using Maven:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn -pl webapp spring-boot:run
----

* Browse to http://localhost:8080.

* Login to using:

** username: `sven`
** password: `pass`

+
The app runs with H2 running in-memory, with sample data set up using fixture scripts.

* Build a Docker image
+
[source,bash]
----
export REVISION=...                 #<.>
export DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME     #<.>
export DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD     #<.>

mvn -pl webapp jib:build
----
<.> used as the image tag
<.> Docker Hub registry username
<.> Docker Hub registry password
+
To push to another container registry, change the `<image>` tag in the pom.xml

== Application Structure

The following table explains the contents of each of the directories:

[width="100%",options="header,footer",stripes="none",cols="2a,4a"]
|====================
|Directory
|Description

|`module-simple`
|Holds the "simple" module, consisting of the `SimpleObject` entity and supporting services.
It also contains module-specific unit- and integration tests.

[TIP]
====
Larger applications should consist of multiple modules; each such module can be copied from this starter module.
====

|`webapp`
|Holds the bootstrapping classes, along with application-level scoped services and home page.
It also contains application-wide integration tests/BDD specs, and lockdown tests.

The `pom.xml` also provides goals to run the app from the command line, or to be assembled into a Docker image.

|====================


== Development

Apache Isis uses DataNucleus as its ORM, which requires that any entities are "enhanced", a post-compile process.

Normally this is done as part of a "mvn clean install", but the entities can also be enhanced explicity using:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -pl module-simple datanucleus:enhance -o
----

This is useful to know if the application or integration test fails to bootstrap, complaining of "unenhanced entities".

TIP: You can also use `enhance-all.sh`


== Testing

The application has three types of tests.
Each of these generates its own set of tests, and each can be disabled through a system property.

.Testing types
[cols="5a,12a,6a,3a", options="header"]
|===

| Test type
| Report
| Phase
| Skip using


| Unit test
| `target/surefire-unittest-reports`
| `test`
| `-DskipUTs`

| Integ test
| `target/surefire-integtest-reports`
| `integration-test`
| `-DskipITs`

| BDD (Cucumber) specs
| `target/surefire-integbddspecs-reports` and +
`target/cucumber-html-reports/overview-features.html`

| `integration-test`
| `-DskipBS`


|===


These outputs can for example be processed within/published by a continuous pipeline pipeline.


=== Lockdown Tests

Lockdown tests capture the state of the system, so that changes to that system can be captured and confirmed.
There are two lockdown tests:

* the metamodel (serialized as XML)
+
This is expected to change whenever the domain logic is changed, but generally should _not_ change when the Apache Isis framework is upgraded.

* Maven dependencies (serialized as flat files)
+
This should only change when dependencies are bumped or new dependencies added.

The lockdown tests are implemented as link:https://approvaltests.com/[approval test]s, meaning that the current state is compared to an "approved" state.
If there are no differences then the test passes.
If there are differences then the test fails, and a diff is shown using any available `diff` tool.

The lockdown tests are disabled by default, and are enabled with system properties.

* to compare the current metamodel with the previously approved metamodel:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn integration-test -Dmetamodel.lockdown
----

* to compare the current Maven dependencies with the previously approved dependencies:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn test -Dmavendeps.lockdown
----

When there are differences, the current state is written to the `current` subdirectory.
If the current state is approved, it should be copied over to the corresponding `approved` subdirectory.




== Translations

Apache Isis supports i18n using link:https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html[GNU .po file]s.
The `WEB-INF/translations.po` is the fallback (an empty value means that the key is used "as-is"), while `WEB-INF/translations-XX.po` files provide translations for each "XX" locale.

Translations are required for all domain classes and all members (actions, properties and collections) of all classes.
This information is available from the metamodel, and so a new template `translations.po` is generated as a side-effect of running the integration tests (through a log4j2 logger).
A good integration test to run is `ValidateDomainModel_IntegTest`.

In addition, translations are required for any validation messages triggered by the test.
Running an integration tests that trigger validations will result in these messages being captured as keys, for example `Smoke_IntegTest`.

The generated file should be merged with any existing translations in `WEB-INF/translations.po`, and translations obtained for any new keys (there are numerous online services that support the format).


== Flyway

The application also demonstrates how to use Flyway to migrate the database schema.

By default the app runs using an in-memory database.
The Flyway example is activated using the "SQLSERVER" Spring Boot profile, eg:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -Dspring.profiles.active=SQLSERVER -pl webapp install
mvn -Dspring.profiles.active=SQLSERVER -pl webapp spring-boot:run
----

This causes the properties defined in  `config/application-SQLSERVER.properties` file to be used in preference to those in the default `config/application.properties` file.
It defines the following:

* `spring.flyway.url`, `spring.flyway.user` and `spring.flyway.password`
+
The presence of these is enough to enable the Flyway integration

* `spring.flyway.enabled`
+
This is explicitly set to `true`, to override the value in the default `config/application.properties`.

* `isis.persistence.jdo-datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll`
+
This is set to `false`, also overriding the value in the default `config/application.properties`.
It instructs the JDO/DataNucleus object store not to automatically create any tables etc.

The Spring Boot profile is also used to add the dependency to the SQL Server driver is included (it is hidden behind a Maven profile).

The prerequisites to try this out are a SQL Server database running on `localhost` and with the credentials as specified in `config/application-SQLSERVER.properties`; adjust as necessary.
