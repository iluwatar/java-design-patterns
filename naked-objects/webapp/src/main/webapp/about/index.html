                This app has been generated using Apache Isis'
                <a href="http://isis.apache.org/intro/getting-started/simple%61pp-archetype.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SimpleApp</a> archetype,
                to create a purposefully minimal application that nevertheless includes fixture data, integration tests and BDD specs.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The app itself consists of a single domain class, <a href="https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/example/application/simple%61pp/dom/src/main/java/dom/simple/SimpleObject.java"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><tt>SimpleObject</tt></a>,
                along with an equally simple (factory/repository) domain service, <a href="https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/example/application/simple%61pp/dom/src/main/java/dom/simple/SimpleObjects.java"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><tt>SimpleObjects</tt></a>.
            </p>

            <p>To access the app:</p>

                    <p>
                        provides accesses to a generic UI for end-users,
                        Isis' <a href="http://isis.apache.org/components/viewers/wicket/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wicket Viewer</a>.
                        As its name suggests, this viewer is built on top of <a href="http://wicket.apache.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Wicket</a>&trade;.

                        <a href="http://restfulobjects.org">Restful Objects</a> spec</td>.  This is part of Apache Isis Core.  The
                        implementation technology is JBoss RestEasy.
