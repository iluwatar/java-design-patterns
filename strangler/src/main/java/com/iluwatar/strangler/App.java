/**
 * The Strangler pattern is a software design pattern that incrementally migrate a legacy system by
 * gradually replacing specific pieces of functionality with new applications and services. As
 * features from the legacy system are replaced, the new system eventually replaces all of the old
 * system's features, strangling the old system and allowing you to decommission it.
 *
 * <p>This pattern is not only about updating but also enhancement.
 *
 * <p>In this example, {@link OldArithmetic} indicates old system and its implementation depends on
 * its source ({@link OldSource}). Now we tend to update system with new techniques and new
 * features. In reality, the system may too complex, so usually need gradual migration. {@link
 * HalfArithmetic} indicates system in the process of migration, its implementation depends on old
 * one ({@link OldSource}) and under development one ({@link HalfSource}). The {@link HalfSource}
 * covers part of {@link OldSource} and add new functionality. You can release this version system
 * with new features, which also supports old version system functionalities. After whole migration,
 * the new system ({@link NewArithmetic}) only depends on new source ({@link NewSource}).
