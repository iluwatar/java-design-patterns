/**
 * This application demonstrates Reactor pattern. The example demonstrated is a Distributed Logging
 * Service where it listens on multiple TCP or UDP sockets for incoming log requests.
 *
 * <p><i>INTENT</i> <br>
 * The Reactor design pattern handles service requests that are delivered concurrently to an
 * application by one or more clients. The application can register specific handlers for processing
 * which are called by reactor on specific events.
 *
 * <p><i>PROBLEM</i> <br>
 * Server applications in a distributed system must handle multiple clients that send them service
 * requests. Following forces need to be resolved:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Availability
 *   <li>Efficiency
 *   <li>Programming Simplicity
 *   <li>Adaptability
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><i>PARTICIPANTS</i> <br>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Synchronous Event De-multiplexer
 *       <p>{@link NioReactor} plays the role of synchronous event de-multiplexer. It waits for
 *       events on multiple channels registered to it in an event loop.
 *   <li>Initiation Dispatcher
 *       <p>{@link NioReactor} plays this role as the application specific {@link ChannelHandler}s
 *       are registered to the reactor.
 *   <li>Handle
 *       <p>{@link AbstractNioChannel} acts as a handle that is registered to the reactor. When any
 *       events occur on a handle, reactor calls the appropriate handler.
 *   <li>Event Handler
 *       <p>{@link ChannelHandler} acts as an event handler, which is bound to a channel and is
 *       called back when any event occurs on any of its associated handles. Application logic
 *       resides in event handlers.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The application utilizes single thread to listen for requests on all ports. It does not create a
 * separate thread for each client, which provides better scalability under load (number of clients
 * increase). The example uses Java NIO framework to implement the Reactor.
