/**
 * This class acts as Synchronous Event De-multiplexer and Initiation Dispatcher of Reactor pattern.
 * Multiple handles i.e. {@link AbstractNioChannel}s can be registered to the reactor, and it blocks
 * for events from all these handles. Whenever an event occurs on any of the registered handles, it
 * synchronously de-multiplexes the event which can be any of read, write or accept, and dispatches
 * the event to the appropriate {@link ChannelHandler} using the {@link Dispatcher}.
 *
 * <p>Implementation: A NIO reactor runs in its own thread when it is started using {@link #start()}
 * method. {@link NioReactor} uses {@link Selector} for realizing Synchronous Event De-multiplexing.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: This is one of the ways to implement NIO reactor, and it does not take care of all
 * possible edge cases which are required in a real application. This implementation is meant to
 * demonstrate the fundamental concepts that lie behind Reactor pattern.
