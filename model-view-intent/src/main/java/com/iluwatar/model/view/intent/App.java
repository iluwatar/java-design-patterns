/**
 * Model-View-Intent is a pattern for implementing user interfaces. Its main advantage over MVVM
 * which it closely mirrors is a minimal public api with which user events can be exposed to the
 * ViewModel. In case of the MVI every event is exposed by using a single method with 1 argument
 * which implements UserEvent interface. Specific parameters can be expressed as its parameters. In
 * this case, we'll be using MVI to implement a simple calculator with +, -, /, * operations and the
 * ability to set the variable. It's important to note, that every user action happens through the
 * view, we never interact with the ViewModel directly.
