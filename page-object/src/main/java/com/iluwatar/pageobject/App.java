/**
 * Page Object pattern wraps an UI component with an application specific API allowing you to
 * manipulate the UI elements without having to dig around with the underlying UI technology used.
 * This is especially useful for testing as it means your tests will be less brittle. Your tests can
 * concentrate on the actual test cases where as the manipulation of the UI can be left to the
 * internals of the page object itself.
 *
 * <p>Due to this reason, it has become very popular within the test automation community. In
 * particular, it is very common in that the page object is used to represent the html pages of a
 * web application that is under test. This web application is referred to as AUT (Application Under
 * Test). A web browser automation tool/framework like Selenium for instance, is then used to drive
 * the automating of the browser navigation and user actions journeys through this web application.
 * Your test class would therefore only be responsible for particular test cases and page object
 * would be used by the test class for UI manipulation required for the tests.
 *
 * <p>In this implementation rather than using Selenium, the HtmlUnit library is used as a
 * replacement to represent the specific html elements and to drive the browser. The purpose of this
 * example is just to provide a simple version that showcase the intentions of this pattern and how
 * this pattern is used in order to understand it.
