/**
 * The Model-View-Presenter(MVP) architectural pattern, helps us achieve what is called "The
 * separation of concerns" principle. This is accomplished by separating the application's logic
 * (Model), GUIs (View), and finally the way that the user's actions update the application's logic
 * (Presenter).
 *
 * <p>In the following example, The {@link FileLoader} class represents the app's logic, the {@link
 * FileSelectorJframe} is the GUI and the {@link FileSelectorPresenter} is responsible to respond to
 * users' actions.
 *
 * <p>Finally, please notice the wiring between the Presenter and the View and between the Presenter
 * and the Model.
