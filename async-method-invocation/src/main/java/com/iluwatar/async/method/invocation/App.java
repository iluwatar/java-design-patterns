/**
 * In this example, we are launching space rockets and deploying lunar rovers.
 *
 * <p>The application demonstrates the async method invocation pattern. The key parts of the pattern
 * are <code>AsyncResult</code> which is an intermediate container for an asynchronously evaluated
 * value, <code>AsyncCallback</code> which can be provided to be executed on task completion and
 * <code>AsyncExecutor</code> that manages the execution of the async tasks.
 *
 * <p>The main method shows example flow of async invocations. The main thread starts multiple tasks
 * with variable durations and then continues its own work. When the main thread has done it's job
 * it collects the results of the async tasks. Two of the tasks are handled with callbacks, meaning
 * the callbacks are executed immediately when the tasks complete.
 *
 * <p>Noteworthy difference of thread usage between the async results and callbacks is that the
 * async results are collected in the main thread but the callbacks are executed within the worker
 * threads. This should be noted when working with thread pools.
 *
 * <p>Java provides its own implementations of async method invocation pattern. FutureTask,
 * CompletableFuture and ExecutorService are the real world implementations of this pattern. But due
 * to the nature of parallel programming, the implementations are not trivial. This example does not
 * take all possible scenarios into account but rather provides a simple version that helps to
 * understand the pattern.
