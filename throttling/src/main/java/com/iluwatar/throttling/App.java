/**
 * Throttling pattern is a design pattern to throttle or limit the use of resources or even a
 * complete service by users or a particular tenant. This can allow systems to continue to function
 * and meet service level agreements, even when an increase in demand places load on resources.
 *
 * <p>In this example there is a {@link Bartender} serving beer to {@link BarCustomer}s. This is a
 * time based throttling, i.e. only a certain number of calls are allowed per second. ({@link
 * BarCustomer}) is the service tenant class having a name and the number of calls allowed. ({@link
 * Bartender}) is the service which is consumed by the tenants and is throttled.
