/**
 * Tolerant Reader is an integration pattern that helps to create robust communication systems. The
 * idea is to be as tolerant as possible when reading data from another service. This way, when the
 * communication schema changes, the readers must not break.
 *
 * <p>In this example we use Java serialization to write representations of {@link RainbowFish}
 * objects to file. {@link RainbowFish} is the initial version which we can easily read and write
 * using {@link RainbowFishSerializer} methods. {@link RainbowFish} then evolves to {@link
 * RainbowFishV2} and we again write it to file with a method designed to do just that. However, the
 * reader client does not know about the new format and still reads with the method designed for V1
 * schema. Fortunately the reading method has been designed with the Tolerant Reader pattern and
 * does not break even though {@link RainbowFishV2} has new fields that are serialized.
