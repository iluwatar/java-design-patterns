/**
 * Factory kit is a creational pattern that defines a factory of immutable content with separated
 * builder and factory interfaces to deal with the problem of creating one of the objects specified

 *
 * <p>In the given example {@link WeaponFactory} represents the factory kit, that contains four
 * {@link Builder}s for creating new objects of the classes implementing {@link Weapon} interface.
 *
 * <p>Each of them can be called with {@link WeaponFactory#create(WeaponType)} method, with an input
 * representing an instance of {@link WeaponType} that needs to be mapped explicitly with desired
 * class type in the factory instance.
