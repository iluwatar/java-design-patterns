/**
 * Single Table Inheritance pattern : <br>
 * It maps each instance of class in an inheritance tree into a single table. <br>
 *
 * <p>In case of current project, in order to specify the Single Table Inheritance to Hibernate we
 * annotate the main Vehicle root class with @Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
 * due to which a single root <b>Vehicle</b> class table will be created in the database and it will
 * have columns for all the fields of it's subclasses(Car, Freighter, Train, Truck). <br>
 * Additional to that, a new separate <b>"vehicle_id"</b> column would be added to the Vehicle table
 * to save the type of the subclass object that is being stored in the database. This value is
 * specified by the @DiscriminatorValue annotation value for each subclass in case of Hibernate.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * Below is the main Spring Boot Application class from where the Program Runs.
 *
 * <p>It implements the CommandLineRunner to run the statements at the start of the application
 * program.
