/**
 * Context and problem Most applications rely on other systems for some data or functionality. For
 * example, when a legacy application is migrated to a modern system, it may still need existing
 * legacy resources. New features must be able to call the legacy system. This is especially true of
 * gradual migrations, where different features of a larger application are moved to a modern system
 * over time.
 *
 * <p>Often these legacy systems suffer from quality issues such as convoluted data schemas or
 * obsolete APIs. The features and technologies used in legacy systems can vary widely from more
 * modern systems. To interoperate with the legacy system, the new application may need to support
 * outdated infrastructure, protocols, data models, APIs, or other features that you wouldn't
 * otherwise put into a modern application.
 *
 * <p>Maintaining access between new and legacy systems can force the new system to adhere to at
 * least some of the legacy system's APIs or other semantics. When these legacy features have
 * quality issues, supporting them "corrupts" what might otherwise be a cleanly designed modern
 * application. Similar issues can arise with any external system that your development team doesn't
 * control, not just legacy systems.
 *
 * <p>Solution Isolate the different subsystems by placing an anti-corruption layer between them.
 * This layer translates communications between the two systems, allowing one system to remain
 * unchanged while the other can avoid compromising its design and technological approach.
