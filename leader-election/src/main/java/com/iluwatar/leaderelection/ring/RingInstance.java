/**
 * Implementation with token ring algorithm. The instances in the system are organized as a ring.
 * Each instance should have a sequential id and the instance with smallest (or largest) id should
 * be the initial leader. All the other instances send heartbeat message to leader periodically to
 * check its health. If one certain instance finds the server done, it will send an election message
 * to the next alive instance in the ring, which contains its own ID. Then the next instance add its
 * ID into the message and pass it to the next. After all the alive instances' ID are add to the
 * message, the message is send back to the first instance, and it will choose the instance with the
 * smallest ID to be the new leader, and then send a leader message to other instances to inform the
 * result.
