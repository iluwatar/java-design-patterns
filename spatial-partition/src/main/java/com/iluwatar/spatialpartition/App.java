/**
 * The idea behind the <b>Spatial Partition</b> design pattern is to enable efficient location of
 * objects by storing them in a data structure that is organised by their positions. This is
 * especially useful in the gaming world, where one may need to look up all the objects within a
 * certain boundary, or near a certain other object, repeatedly. The data structure can be used to
 * store moving and static objects, though in order to keep track of the moving objects, their
 * positions will have to be reset each time they move. This would mean having to create a new
 * instance of the data structure each frame, which would use up additional memory, and so this
 * pattern should only be used if one does not mind trading memory for speed and the number of
 * objects to keep track of is large to justify the use of the extra space.
 *
 * <p>In our example, we use <b>{@link QuadTree} data structure</b> which divides into 4 (quad)
 * sub-sections when the number of objects added to it exceeds a certain number (int field
 * capacity). There is also a <b>{@link Rect}</b> class to define the boundary of the quadtree. We
 * use an abstract class <b>{@link Point}</b> with x and y coordinate fields and also an id field so
 * that it can easily be put and looked up in the hashmap. This class has abstract methods to define
 * how the object moves (move()), when to check for collision with any object (touches(obj)) and how
 * to handle collision (handleCollision(obj)), and will be extended by any object whose position has
 * to be kept track of in the quadtree. The <b>{@link SpatialPartitionGeneric}</b> abstract class
 * has 2 fields - a hashmap containing all objects (we use hashmap for faster lookups, insertion and
 * deletion) and a quadtree, and contains an abstract method which defines how to handle
 * interactions between objects using the quadtree.
 *
 * <p>Using the quadtree data structure will reduce the time complexity of finding the objects
 * within a certain range from <b>O(n^2) to O(nlogn)</b>, increasing the speed of computations
 * immensely in case of large number of objects, which will have a positive effect on the rendering
 * speed of the game.
