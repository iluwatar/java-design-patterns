/**
 * FanOut/FanIn pattern is a concurrency pattern that refers to executing multiple instances of the
 * activity function concurrently. The "fan out" part is essentially splitting the data into
 * multiple chunks and then calling the activity function multiple times, passing the chunks.
 *
 * <p>When each chunk has been processed, the "fan in" takes place that aggregates results from each
 * instance of function and forms a single final result.
 *
 * <p>This pattern is only really useful if you can “chunk” the workload in a meaningful way for
 * splitting up to be processed in parallel.
