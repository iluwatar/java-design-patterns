/**
 * The basic idea behind the Identity Map is to have a series of maps containing objects that have
 * been pulled from the database. The below example demonstrates the identity map pattern by
 * creating a sample DB. Since only 1 DB has been created we only have 1 map corresponding to it for
 * the purpose of this demo. When you load an object from the database, you first check the map. If
 * there’s an object in it that corresponds to the one you’re loading, you return it. If not, you go
 * to the database, putting the objects on the map for future reference as you load them.
