/**
 * The Acyclic Visitor pattern allows new functions to be added to existing class hierarchies
 * without affecting those hierarchies, and without creating the dependency cycles that are inherent
 * to the GoF Visitor pattern, by making the Visitor base class degenerate
 *
 * <p>In this example the visitor base class is {@link ModemVisitor}. The base class of the visited
 * hierarchy is {@link Modem} and has two children {@link Hayes} and {@link Zoom} each one having
 * its own visitor interface {@link HayesVisitor} and {@link ZoomVisitor} respectively. {@link
 * ConfigureForUnixVisitor} and {@link ConfigureForDosVisitor} implement each derivative's visit
 * method only if it is required
