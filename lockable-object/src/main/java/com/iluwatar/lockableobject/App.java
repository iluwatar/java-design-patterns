/**
 * The Lockable Object pattern is a concurrency pattern. Instead of using the "synchronized" word
 * upon the methods to be synchronized, the object which implements the Lockable interface handles
 * the request.
 *
 * <p>In this example, we create a new Lockable object with the SwordOfAragorn implementation of it.
 * Afterward we create 6 Creatures with the Elf, Orc and Human implementations and assign them each
 * to a Fiend object and the Sword is the target object. Because there is only one Sword, and it
 * uses the Lockable Object pattern, only one creature can hold the sword at a given time. When the
 * sword is locked, any other alive Fiends will try to lock, which will result in a race to lock the
 * sword.
