/**
 * The Memento pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object
 * to its previous state (undo via rollback).
 *
 * <p>The Memento pattern is implemented with three objects: the originator, a caretaker and a
 * memento. The originator is some object that has an internal state. The caretaker is going to do
 * something to the originator, but wants to be able to undo the change. The caretaker first asks
 * the originator for a memento object. Then it does whatever operation (or sequence of operations)
 * it was going to do. To roll back to the state before the operations, it returns the memento
 * object to the originator. The memento object itself is an opaque object (one which the caretaker
 * cannot, or should not, change). When using this pattern, care should be taken if the originator
 * may change other objects or resources - the memento pattern operates on a single object.
 *
 * <p>In this example the object ({@link Star}) gives out a "memento" ({@link StarMemento}) that
 * contains the state of the object. Later on the memento can be set back to the object restoring
 * the state.
