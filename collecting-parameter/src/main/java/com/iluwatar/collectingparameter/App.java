/**
 * The Collecting Parameter Design Pattern aims to return a result that is the collaborative result
 * of several methods. This design pattern uses a 'collecting parameter' that is passed to several
 * functions, accumulating results as it travels from method-to-method. This is different to the
 * Composed Method design pattern, where a single collection is modified via several methods.
 *
 * <p>This example is inspired by Kent Beck's example in his book, 'Smalltalk Best Practice
 * Patterns'. The context for this situation is that there is a single printer queue {@link
 * PrinterQueue} that holds numerous print jobs {@link PrinterItem} that must be distributed to
 * various print centers. Each print center has its own requirements and printing limitations. In
 * this example, the following requirements are: If an A4 document is coloured, it must also be
 * single-sided. All other non-coloured A4 documents are accepted. All A3 documents must be
 * non-coloured and single sided. All A2 documents must be a single page, single sided, and
 * non-coloured.
 *
 * <p>A collecting parameter (the result variable) is used to filter the global printer queue so
 * that it meets the requirements for this centre,
