/**
 * Guarded-suspension is a concurrent design pattern for handling situation when to execute some
 * action we need condition to be satisfied. The implementation utilizes a GuardedQueue, which
 * features two primary methods: `get` and `put`. The key condition governing these operations is
 * that elements cannot be retrieved (`get`) from an empty queue. When a thread attempts to retrieve
 * an element under this condition, it triggers the invocation of the `wait` method from the Object
 * class, causing the thread to pause. Conversely, when an element is added (`put`) to the queue by
 * another thread, it invokes the `notify` method. This notifies the waiting thread that it can now
 * successfully retrieve an element from the queue.
