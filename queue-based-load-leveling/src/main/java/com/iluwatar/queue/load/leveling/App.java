/**
 * Many solutions in the cloud involve running tasks that invoke services. In this environment, if a
 * service is subjected to intermittent heavy loads, it can cause performance or reliability issues.
 *
 * <p>A service could be a component that is part of the same solution as the tasks that utilize it,
 * or it could be a third-party service providing access to frequently used resources such as a
 * cache or a storage service. If the same service is utilized by a number of tasks running
 * concurrently, it can be difficult to predict the volume of requests to which the service might be
 * subjected at any given point in time.
 *
 * <p>We will build a queue-based-load-leveling to solve above problem. Refactor the solution and
 * introduce a queue between the task and the service. The task and the service run asynchronously.
 * The task posts a message containing the data required by the service to a queue. The queue acts
 * as a buffer, storing the message until it is retrieved by the service. The service retrieves the
 * messages from the queue and processes them. Requests from a number of tasks, which can be
 * generated at a highly variable rate, can be passed to the service through the same message queue.
 *
 * <p>The queue effectively decouples the tasks from the service, and the service can handle the
 * messages at its own pace irrespective of the volume of requests from concurrent tasks.
 * Additionally, there is no delay to a task if the service is not available at the time it posts a
 * message to the queue.
 *
 * <p>In this example we have a class {@link MessageQueue} to hold the message {@link Message}
 * objects. All the worker threads {@link TaskGenerator} will submit the messages to the
 * MessageQueue. The service executor class {@link ServiceExecutor} will pick up one task at a time
 * from the Queue and execute them.
