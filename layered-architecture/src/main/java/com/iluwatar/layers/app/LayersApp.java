/**
 * The Layers pattern is a structural design pattern that organizes system architecture into
 * distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility and abstraction level. This separation
 * allows for increased modularity, facilitating independent development, maintenance, and reuse of
 * each layer. Commonly, layers interact with each other through well-defined interfaces, with
 * higher layers (more abstract) depending on lower layers (more concrete), but not vice versa,
 * promoting a clear hierarchy and separation of concerns.
