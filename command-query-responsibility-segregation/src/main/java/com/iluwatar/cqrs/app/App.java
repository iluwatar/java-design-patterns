/**
 * CQRS : Command Query Responsibility Segregation. A pattern used to separate query services from
 * commands or writes services. The pattern is very simple, but it has many consequences. For
 * example, it can be used to tackle down a complex domain, or to use other architectures that were
 * hard to implement with the classical way.
 *
 * <p>This implementation is an example of managing books and authors in a library. The persistence
 * of books and authors is done according to the CQRS architecture. A command side that deals with a
 * data model to persist(insert,update,delete) objects to a database. And a query side that uses
 * native queries to get data from the database and return objects as DTOs (Data transfer Objects).
