/**
 * The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the
 * type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce
 * new objects. This pattern is used to: - avoid subclasses of an object creator in the client
 * application, like the abstract factory pattern, does. - avoid the inherent cost of creating a new
 * object in the standard way (e.g., using the 'new' keyword)
 *
 * <p>In this example we have a factory class ({@link HeroFactoryImpl}) producing objects by cloning
 * the existing ones. The factory's prototype objects are given as constructor parameters.
